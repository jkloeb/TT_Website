        <!-- The Problem -->
        <section id="theProblem">
            <p class="text">The prompt given to us by our client, Teletracking, emphasized the role of hospitals in disaster situations. Specifically the fact that thereâ€™s a large surge of non-patients seeking shelter as hospitals are viewed as safe places and generally have a backup source of power. They wanted us to create a solution that would help citizens, including those with medical needs and their caretakers, better handle disasters as well as help alleviate the inflow situation in hospitals during disasters. This should, ideally, take the form of an app for citizens as well as data solutions for hospital employees in disasters.</p>

            <p class="subHeading">Haven</p>
            <p class="text">The core of our solution is a mobile application. Haven helps people prepare for when a disaster strikes and deal with it while it's happening. It includes preparation tools, shelter registration, and evacuation routes. We specifically focused on hurricanes in Florida: Teletracking's clients having the greatest issues related are located along Florida's Gulf coast.</p>
            <div class="appIcon"><img id="appIcon" src="images/appIcon.png"/></div>
            <p class="text">Our research indicates that the surge of non-patients to hospitals during disasters stems from a lack of preparation. People either don't have what they need to shelter in place, or they aren't aware of their other options for sheltering. People with special medical needs and their caregivers especially contribute to the surge in hospitals during storms. Haven helps to alleviate congestion in hospitals during disasters by addressing these issues head on. It provides a step by step guide to preparation.  Users can also pre-register at medical needs shelters.</p>

            <p class="text">Aside from the mobile app, we also developed a service plan outlining areas outside of the app and a road map with future uses of our solution. The service plan emphasizes the importance of data in helping hospitals manage patient inflows during disasters, playing to our client's strengths in bed tracking and patient management.</p>
