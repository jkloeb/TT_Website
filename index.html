    <!-- The Problem -->
    <section id="theProblem">
        <p class="heading">The Problem</p>
        <p class="text">The prompt given to us by our client, Teletracking, emphasized the role of hospitals in disaster situations. Specifically the fact that thereâ€™s a large surge of non-patients seeking shelter as hospitals are viewed as safe places and generally have a backup source of power. They wanted us to create a solution that would help citizens, including those with medical needs and their caretakers, better handle disasters as well as help alleviate the inflow situation in hospitals during disasters. This should, ideally, take the form of an app for citizens as well as data solutions for hospital employees in disasters.</p>

        <p class="subHeading">The App</p>
        <!-- Summary of functions-->
        <p class="text">The core of our solution is a mobile application. This app helps people prepare for when a diaster strikes and deal with it while it's happening. It includes preparation tools, shelter registration, and evacuation routes. We specifically focused on hurricanes in Florida. Teletracking's clients who have had the greatest issues rerlated are located in Florida and the type of disasters they most deal with are hurricanes.</p>
        <div class="imageApp"><img id="imageApp" src="images/imagesApp.png"</div>
        <!-- How it addresses the problem-->
        <p class="text">From our research we learned that the surge of non-patients to hospitals during disasters stems from a lack of preparation. People either don't have what they need to shelter in place, or they aren't aware of their other options for sheltering. Specifically, people with special medical needs and their caregivers contribute to the surge in hospitals during storms. Our application helps to alleviate congestion in hospitals during disasters by addressing these issues head on. It provides a step by step guide to preparation.  It also alows people to pre-register at shelters, both those for the general population and those with medical needs. If people have what they need and know where to go to stay safe, they shouldn't need to clog up hospitals if they aren't injured, or ill.</p>

        <p class="subHeading">Additional Solutions</p>
        <!-- Summary of functions-->
        <p class="text">Aside from the mobile app, we also developed a service plan outlining areas outside of the app and a road map with future uses of our solution. The service plan emphasizes the importance of data in helping hospitals manage patient inflows during disasters, playing to our client's strengths in bed tracking and patient management.</p>
        <p class="text">The road map is all about exanding the service, including the app, to other diasaster areas. This includes areas in both the geographic and contextual sense: Hurricane service to the rest of Florida as well as other hurricane prone states such as Louisiana and South Carolina, earthquake preparation and planning for California, winter storm help for the North East and Mid-West, etc.</p>
