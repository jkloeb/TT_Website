            <p class="subHeading">Methods Used</p>
            <!-- List of Methods -->
            <ul class="methodList">
                <li>Secondary Research: A comprehensive reading of literature, both academic and popular related, to a host of topics related to disasters.</li>
                <li>Guerrilla Research: Quick and dirty interviews with people about their experiences with disasters, or what they think they would do in a disaster. </li>
                <li>Interviews: Detailed interviews, mostly over gchat with experts in the domain of disaster preparation and management.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">From these we initialy learned that non-patient inflow might not be an issue in disaster situations. However, when we met with our client at their office and conducted a number of interviews and participatory exercises they insisted that this is indeed a problem for many of their clients. This puzzled us. Luckily, Teletracking put us in touch with these clients for remote interviews. It turns out, these clientâ€™s did indeed have an issue with non-patients turning up in disasters.</p>

            <p class="text">From exploratory research we had to generate solutions that could help people and institutions in disasters. For this, we turned to a number of generative research methods:</p>
            <!-- List of Methods -->
            <ul class="methodList">
                <li>Stakeholder Mapping: Who are the actors in a disaster situation and how do they interact with and rely on each-other?</li>
                <li>How Might We?: Drafting ideas of how solutions to our problems could ideally work.</li>
                <li>Crazy 8s: Generating 8 ideas to solve a specific problem in a period of 8 minutes. Repeat</li>
                <li>Visioning: Collaborative sketching. This generated some of our wildest ideas</li>
                <li>Storyboarding: Here we illustrated scenarios of some of our favored ideas from the above exercises in action. We then used these to test (Speed-dating) our ideas out with key stakeholders.</li>
